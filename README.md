# SpyGame

The Spy Game is a real-time, puzzle game featuring the
theme of espionage. You will play using the role of a spy, infiltrating enemy
bases with the goal of hacking information out of their computer terminals.
As you try to accomplish this, there will be NPCs acting as your obstacles.
The project is done using the multi-agent programmable modeling environ-
ment called NetLogo 6.0. While this platform has it's limitations, it certainly
provided the tools to make the creation of this game possible.
In this report we shall see how the game system is modeled and we will dis-
cuss the reasons why it was modeled in that particular way. We will discuss
the multi-agent interactions, the system state changes, the way the game
works etc.

To view the game you need NetLogo 6.0. This also includes a pdf file called Project Report for a detailed explanation.
